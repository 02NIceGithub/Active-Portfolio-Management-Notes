# Solutions and notes for: Active Portfolio Management
The book was written by Grinold and Kahn.

the source code is copied from https://github.com/RJT1990/Active-Portfolio-Management-Notes

I'm trying to show the thoroughly proofs and/or solutions for all the exercises in the book.
Of course, I am not able to do it by myself, so I invite you join me:)

The file is named 'apm.tex', where 'apm' means 'Active portfolio management'.
